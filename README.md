# Walmart Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is part of my data analysis journey, where I perform an in-depth analysis of Walmart's sales data to answer key business questions using SQL. The dataset includes transaction details, product information, customer types, and other key variables. By performing various feature engineering techniques and running SQL queries, this project aims to deliver meaningful insights for business decision-making.

The analysis includes exploring sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance, which can help businesses optimize their strategies.
